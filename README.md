# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo!

Congratulations, you've stumbled upon the repository that will change your life forever. Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's still pretty cool.

## About Me

I'm a nerd who loves many wonderful, funny, interesting, or weird things. When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me binge-watching bad movies (seriously, the higher the number of sequels the better, spoiling my two furbabies, or trying to monetize my delicious sugary creations.

## Projects

I've created some pretty awesome projects over the years, if I do say so myself. From an app that help you focus on your creative writing to the app that help you select makeup products that are good for you and the earth, my portfolio has it all.

## Contact Me

Want to get in touch? Send me a message on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-west-code-wrangler/), and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Or, you know, you could just shout really loudly and hope I hear you.

## Thanks for Visiting!

Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio. Now go forth and conquer the coding world! Or, you know, take a nap. Naps are good too.
